mount folder
------------

Place your pwnable binary as well as the flag.txt file here. No need to set permissions on those files :)

The folder should look as follows:
```
drwxr-xr-x 2 saksham saksham 4096 Jan 15 16:01 .
drwxr-xr-x 6 saksham docker  4096 Jan 15 15:58 ..
-rwx------ 1 saksham saksham   73 Jan 15 15:40 binary
-rwx------ 1 saksham saksham   17 Jan 15 15:46 flag.txt
-rwx------ 1 saksham saksham  178 Jan 15 16:01 README.md
```
